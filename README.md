# Comp304-Project2
We have implemented the Project 2 of the COMP304 lesson.
You can run the program by running the;
```
make
make run
```
If you want to specialize the command use -p -s -t instead as shown below;

```
gcc project2_src.cpp -lpthread -lstdc++ -o project2.out && ./project2.out -p #PROBABILITY -s #SIMTIME -t #T
```
We have uploaded logs. But we haven't encountered to any events of the police.
